This directory contains the Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 solution that builds both the GOTM exectuable
and the 0-dimensional biogeochemical driver driver on Windows.

For this to work, you will need to have both Visual Studio 2005 and the Intel Visual Fortran Compiler
installed. The latter integrates with Visual Studio, provided you have a suitable version (at least
the IVFC versions 9 to 11 support integration with VS 2005).

To start, open "gotm.sln" - the main solution file.

Note: this solution can also be opened by Visual Studio 2008, but that triggers a non-reversible
conversion to the 2008 solution format.
