The GOTM source code.

This documnet contains important information on how to obtain the source code,
an explenation on the version # scheme used in GOTM (stable and unstable releases
and finally how to compile GOTM and finally how to contribute to further GOTM
development.

How to get the code:
The most recent release can always be obtained from http://www.gotm.net in the 
section download. The source code comes as a gzipped tar file (can be unpacked
both under Windoews using WinZip and Unix using gzip) which in addition to the
source code itself contains various other information, e.g. Copyright information.

Stable and unstable releases:
The version number scheme used in GOTM is similar to the system used by the Linux
kernel. The version number has the following form:
VERSION.LEVEL.SUBLEVEL
where VERSION is the major version number. This number will only change when 
there has been major changes in the core of the GOTM model. The LEVEL number 
defines whether it is a stable or unstable (developers) release. If the LEVEL number
is even it is a stable release and if LEVEL is un-even it is a unstable release.
The SUBLEVEL number will be increased whenever bugs have been fixed or new features/
modules are included - which will only change to core of GOTM a limited number of 
places an not the overall structure of the code.


How to compile GOTM:
The first requirement for compiling GOTM is a F90/F95 compiler.
If only the stable version is considered this is enough. 
To compile the unstable two more things are necessary: preprocessing of the source
code should be possible, a build system which will allow the source code to be placed in different directories. 

Documentation of the source code:
The source code has been documented by embedding additional information in the code
itself.
