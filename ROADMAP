This is a list of the anticipated extensions to GOTM in the near future. 

Physical features:
- convective adjustment as simple mixing parameterization for instable 
  stratification
- K-profile parameterization (KPP) for vertical mixing coefficients according
  to Large et al. [1994] 
- prescription of horizontal gradients for temperature and salinity 
  (and with that density)
- linearization of equation of state 

Boundary conditions:
- surface buoyancy flux for buoyancy equation
- surface fluxes (precipitation - evaporation, P-E) for salinity equation   
- relaxation of surface temperature and salinity to measurements as simple  
  parameterization of surface fluxes

Biological features:
- simple seagrass dynamics according to Verduin and Backhaus [1999]
- simple phytoplancton model  

Informatic features:
- reorganization of namelist input
- imposing a new system for time calculation
- restructuring code for easier inclusion of new features
