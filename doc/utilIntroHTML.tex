\section{Utilities}\label{sec:util}

\subsection{Introduction}

Here, some completely different utility modules and
routines are assembled,
such as the time module (see {\tt time.F90}) keeping track of all 
time calculations,
the tridiagonal module with the Gaussian solver for systems of equations
with tri--diagonal matrices (see {\tt tridiagonal.F90}),
the equation of state module (see {\tt eqstate.F90}) and some 
helpful routines such as the general advection--diffusion solver
(see {\tt yevol.F90}), the vertical advection routine
(see {\tt w\_split\_it\_adv.F90}) and the vertical interpolation routine
(see {\tt gridinterpol.F90}). For detailed discussion of the various
advection schemes, see \cite{Pietrzak98} and \cite{BurchardBolding2002}.
