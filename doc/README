Currently, there are three versions of the GOTM documentation with the
names:

code_a4.filetype
code_letter.filetype
code_html.filetype

"filetype" can be dvi, ps, or pdf. To produce these files type "make
"papertype_filetype" in this directory. For example, 

"make letter_pdf"

will create the documention in US-letter format, which
can be display with 

"acroread code_letter.pdf".

The files "code_html.filetype" are without figures, because
"latex2html" does not yet work for our postscript-figures. Currently, only the
LaTeX files "meanflowIntro.tex" and "utilIntro.tex" are
different from the printed versions, with figures commented out.
Also the figure on the titlepage is missing.

To produce the html-code type "make html_web".
To copy code to the server type "make html_scp".
