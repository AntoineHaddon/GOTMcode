Currently, there are three versions of the GOTM documentation with the
names:

code_a4.filetype
code_letter.filetype
code_html.filetype

"filetype" can be dvi, ps, or pdf. To produce these files type "make
"papertype_filetype" in this directory. For example, "make
letter_pdf" will create the documention in US-letter format, which
can be display with "acroread code_letter.pdf".

The files "code_html.filetype" are without figures, because
"latex2html" does not yet work for our postscript-figures. Currently, only the
LaTeX files "meanflowIntro.tex" and "utilIntro.tex" are
different from the printed versions, with figures commented out.
Also the figure on the titlepage is missing.

To produce the html-code type "make html_web".
To copy code on the server type "make html_scp".

Note, that there is no reason any more to run things like "make doc"
in the gotm/src directory. If you change anything in a LaTeX source
file, "make" will notice it, and the *.dvi, *.ps, *.pdf, and *.html
files will be always updated automatically if you make them. Also 
files copied to the server will be checked if they are up to date.
