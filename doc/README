Currently, there are three versions of the GOTM documentation with the
names:

code_a4.filetype
code_letter.filetype
code_html.filetype

"filetype" can be dvi, ps, or pdf. To produce these files type "make
code_*.filetype" in this directory. For example, "make
code_letter.pdf" will create the documention in "letter" format, which
you can display with "acroread letter.pdf".

The files "code_html.filetype" are without figures, because
"latex2html" does not yet work for our figures.  Currently, only the
LaTeX files "meanflowIntro.tex" and "utilIntro.tex" are
different from the printed versions, with figures commented out.
Also the figure on the titlepage is missing.

To produce the html-code in ./code_html/ type "make html".
To copy code on the server type "make html_scp".

Note, that there is no reason any more to run things like "make doc"
in the gotm/src directory. If you change anything in a LaTeX source
file, "make" will notice it, and the *.dvi, *.ps, *.pdf, and *.html
files will be always updated automatically if you make them. Also 
files copied to the server will be checked if they are up to date.
