\section{Extra features \label{sec:extra}}

Here, some extra features are stored which are up to now

\begin{itemize}
\item the {\tt sediment} module and
\item the {\tt seagrass} module.
\end{itemize}

A test scenario to become acquainted with the {\tt sediment} module
is discussed in \sect{rouse}, where the so-called Rouse-profile
is reproduced. The {\tt seagrass} scenario in \sect{seagrass} 
investigates the \cite{VerduinBackhaus2000} seagrass-current
simulations.
